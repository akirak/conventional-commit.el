This library provides support for [[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/][conventional commits]] in Emacs.
It provides a completion function for types and scopes.
** Configuration
If you are using =eglot= or =lsp-mode=, you have probably added =company-capf= to =company-backends= already.
You can use the following =use-package= snippet to enable company completion in =git-commit-mode=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package conventional-commit
    :hook
    (git-commit-mode . conventional-commit-setup))
#+end_src

If you haven't, you have to add =company-capf= to =company-backends=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'company-backends #'company-capf)
#+end_src

To configure the list of types, customize =conventional-commit-type-list= variable.

To configure scopes, set =conventional-commit-scope-table= in =.dir-locals.el= of your project.
